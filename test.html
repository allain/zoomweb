<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm trying to push the maximum scale to see where it can go without being too jittery.</p>

  <h2>What is a Zoomable User Interface (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface">from Wikipedia</a>)</h2>
  
  <p>In computing, a zooming user interface or zoomable user interface (ZUI, pronounced zoo-ee) is a graphical 
  environment where users can change the scale of the viewed area in order to see more detail or less, and browse
  through different documents. A ZUI is a type of graphical user interface (GUI). Information elements appear directly
  on an infinite virtual desktop (usually created using vector graphics), instead of in windows. Users can pan across
  the virtual surface in two dimensions and zoom into objects of interest. For example, as you zoom into a text object
  it may be represented as a small dot, then a thumbnail of a page of text, then a full-sized page and finally a
  magnified view of the page.</p>
  
  <p>ZUIs use zooming as the main metaphor for browsing through hyperlinked information. Objects present inside a zoomed
  page can in turn be zoomed themselves to reveal further detail, allowing for recursive nesting and an arbitrary level of zoom.</p>
  
  <p>When the level of detail present in the resized object is changed to fit the relevant information into the current
  size, instead of being a proportional view of the whole object, it's called semantic zooming.</p>
  
  <p>Some experts consider the ZUI interface paradigm as a flexible and realistic successor to the traditional
  windowing GUI. But little effort is currently spent developing ZUIs, while there are ongoing efforts for developing GUIs.</p>

<h2><a href="http://piccolo2d.org">Piccolo2D</a> - A Structured 2D Graphics Framework</h2>

<p>Welcome to Piccolo2D! A revolutionary way to create robust, full-featured graphical applications in Java and C#,
with striking visual effects such as zooming, animation and multiple representations.</p>

<p>Piccolo2D is a toolkit that supports the development of 2D structured graphics programs, in general, and Zoomable
User Interfaces (ZUIs), in particular. A ZUI is a new kind of interface that presents a huge canvas of information on
a traditional computer display by letting the user smoothly zoom in, to get more detailed information, and zoom out
for an overview. We use a "scene graph" model that is common to 3D environments. Basically, this means that Piccolo2D
maintains a hierarchal structure of objects and cameras, allowing the application developer to orient, group and
manipulate objects in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>Why use Piccolo2D? It will allow you to build structured graphical applications without worrying so much about
the low level details. The infrastructure provides efficient repainting of the screen, bounds management, event
handling and dispatch, picking (determining which visual object the mouse is over), animation, layout, and more.
Normally, you would have to write all of this code from scratch. Additionally, if you want to build an application
with zooming, that's built right into the framework too.</p>

<p>What exactly is it? Piccolo2D is a layer built on top of a lower level graphics API. There are currently three
versions of the toolkit: Piccolo2D.Java, Piccolo2D.NET and PocketPiccolo2D.NET (for the .NET Compact Framework). 
The java version is built on Java 2 and relies on the Java2D API to do its graphics rendering. The .NET version is
built on the .NET Framework and relies on the GDI+ API to do its graphics rendering. This makes it easy for Java and
C# programmers, even those targeting PDAs, to build their own animated graphical applications. And best of all,
Piccolo2D is free and open source!</p>
